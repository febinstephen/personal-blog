Today we're releasing Connect, a slim framework for building browser and gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs. Connect is production-ready — focused, simple, and debuggable — and it's fully compatible with gRPC clients and servers. If you're frustrated by the complexity and instability of today's gRPC libraries, we think you'll find Connect a breath of fresh air. connect-go is available now under an Apache 2 open source license, and documentation is available on connect.build. We'll release Connect for TypeScript soon, with more languages to follow.
